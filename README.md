# QR-Code-Marketing-Dashboard

My Capstone from Sparta Course SP401: Dashboards and Drill-Down Analytics.

Here is the summary based on the dashboard I created.
> Only on January and April the number of scans reached the goal.
> Average Actual Scan Through Rate is 3.55% which is way below the goal 6%.
> November is the month that has the highest impressions.
> Landing Page 3 has the highest conversion.
> Magazine Ad generated the most scans.
> Highest conversion is on the month of December.
