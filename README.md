# QR Code Marketing Report 
As I keep on progressing in my Sparta's courses. I started to learn more on analyzing and interpreting the data. It is fun since it is challenging and makes me really use mind like I experienced with programming. I made it with KISS on my mind Keep It Short and Simple which I learned when taking Google Data Analytics Course.
